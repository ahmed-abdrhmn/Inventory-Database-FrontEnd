# Introduction
This is a frontend for the [Inventory-Database](https://github.com/Shai7aleb/Inventory-Database) backend that I wrote a few weeks ago. This is written in typescript using the Angular 17 framework along with material design. Here, you can view and modify all the entities in the backend system, in an easy-to-use and smooth user interface.
